# DeepFake Detection Using customized CNNs (with optimizations)

# Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a DeepFake detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other deep learning models. The goal is to identify AI-generated or manipulated facial images and videos, which are increasingly used in misinformation, identity theft, and malicious activities.

# Key Components

Models Used:

- custom_cnn.ipynb: A custom-built CNN architecture for detecting DeepFakes.
- densenet.ipynb: Implementation of DenseNet for feature extraction and classification.
- vggface.ipynb: Utilizes VGGFace for face recognition and forgery detection.
- DeepFake_hybrid_model_4_epochs.ipynb: A hybrid model trained over 4 epochs, combining multiple architectures.
- XAI_implementation.ipynb: Incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to interpret model predictions.
- XAI_implementation_finalized_4epoch_3-3.ipynb: Finalized version with optimized XAI visualization for better interpretability.
