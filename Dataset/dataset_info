This dataset consists of all 70k REAL faces from the Flickr dataset collected by Nvidia, as well as 70k fake faces sampled from the 1 Million FAKE faces (generated by StyleGAN) 


This dataset was constructed by combining real and fake face images from publicly available sources, with appropriate acknowledgment to the original authors. All images were resized to a uniform resolution of 256×256 pixels, and the dataset was divided into training, validation, and test sets. CSV metadata files were also included for easier integration into machine learning pipelines.

- Real Faces Dataset: The real images were sourced from the Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC) hosted by Facebook AI. Community discussion and further details are available at:

- 1 Million Fake Faces Dataset: The fake images were obtained from the same challenge, referring specifically to the widely discussed “1 Million Fake Faces” contribution. Details can be found at:

We the authors express sincere appreciation to the original dataset creators and Kaggle contributors for openly sharing these resources ( whose link has been shared above). This combined dataset is released for research and educational purposes in the area of deepfake detection, computer vision, and facial forensics.
